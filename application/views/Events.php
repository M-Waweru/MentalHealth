									<span>Using zumba to address mental health stigma</span>
								</h4>

								</h4>
								<p>Zumba is perfect for everybody and every body! Each Zumba class is designed to bring people together to sweat it on.

                                Zumba takes the “work” out of workout, by mixing low-intensity and high-intensity moves for an interval-style, calorie-burning dance fitness party. Once the Latin and World rhythms take over, you’ll see why Zumba Fitness classes are often called exercise in disguise. Super effective? Check. Super fun? Check and check.

                                A total workout, combining all elements of fitness – cardio, muscle conditioning, balance and flexibility, boosted energy and a serious dose of awesome each time you leave class. Learn more at zumba.com.
									<span>Come and dance for a great cause!<br>
										WHEN: Sep 14th from 2 to 3:30 pm

                                        WHERE: Will be communicated

									<span>Music for mental health</span>
								</h4>
								<h4>Sep 30TH, 2018,&nbsp;&nbsp; posted By
									<a href="#" class="post">Music</a>
								</h4>
								<p>Pearl Piano is generously hosting HIGH NOTES AVANTE for a third time as we present this very special concert--a collaboration between JOANNA GRACE of Clearly Home Concerts and INGRID TAHERI, Artistic & Executive Director of High Notes Avante. The concert features music by composers (Beethoven, Schumann and Rachmanninov) who were affected by mental illness. Author DAVID W. BARBER will talk about their lives and challenges. Still, they produced beautiful and hopeful music which we can’t wait to share. Among them, Beethoven's sonata No. 1 in F major for cello (but performed on the horn)

                                The concert part of this event lasts about an hour with plenty of time to mingle with others and ask questions. Pearl Piano will very generously donate parts of their September sales to High Notes Avante so if you are considering purchasing a piano, have a look around the store.

                                All proceeds support High Notes Avante in our continued efforts to raise the image of mental illness by producing events (such as this one) that bring people together socially to learn and support each other.

									<span>HIGH NOTES AVANTE inspires, gives hope and connects those touched by mental illness through artistic expression.<br><br>
										The time and venue will be communicated!
